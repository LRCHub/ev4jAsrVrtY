Still gotta compete despite what we once had, what we once had
And I'll aim for excellence, if it's what you want, if it's what you want
And I'll cut away for when you hit a place
So hope and I'll pray that when I show my face
I'll get through annoying you and it won't just be all about you

So
Let's share a word
We'll talk for hours
'Cause I want it that way, cause I want it that way
So
Let's share a word
We'll talk for hours
'Cause I want it that way, cause I want it that way

Still gotta get focus on the little cracks, the small setbacks
If it's gonna be you and me then honesty's the policy
And I can't complain if I dunno how
And the corners in this maze will slowly iron out
I've got plans too good for through, the future brings me down but I got you
The future brings me down but I got you, yeah

So
Let's share a word
We'll talk for hours
'Cause I want it that way, cause I want it that way

So
Let's share a word
We'll talk for hours
'Cause I want it that way, cause I want it that way

So let's share a word
'Cause I want it that way
I don't know what you've gone and heard
But let's keep it that way
So let's share a word
'Cause I want it that way
I don't know what you've gone and heard
But let's keep it that way
